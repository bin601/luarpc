Lua-RPC is a Lua library to allow simple remote procedure
calling. That is, a Lua script running on one machine can call
functions from a script that is running on another machine.

This is version 0.2, a pre-alpha release.

The goal of this project is to create an RPC module for Lua that is both
simple and light on resource usage. In addition, the module intends to
maintain separation between the actual RPC protocol and the underlying
mechanism that transmits bytes between client and server. This is done in
order to enable the use of the protocol over a variety of link types including
sockets and RS-232.

BUILDING
--------

In order to build the module, just type:

make

This should succeed if you have Lua already installed on a Linux or Mac OS X
system. If it does not succeed, feel free to contact me at
jbsnyder@fanplastic.org.

As of May 28, 2009, serial and socket "transport" modes should be functional.
One can switch between these by selectively commenting/uncommenting lines in
config.h as below:

/* #define LUARPC_ENABLE_SOCKET */
#define LUARPC_ENABLE_SERIAL

This builds the module in serial mode. At this time, one cannot build with
multiple modes enabled (this may be added in the future).


USAGE
-----

The result of the build is a .so file that within a Lua script, one should be
able to simply do a:

require("luarpc")

with the module in the Lua path, and use the module as suggested in
test-client.lua and test-server.lua.

Ensure that your scripts reflect the type of enabled "transport" in use.
