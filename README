Lua-RPC is a Lua library to allow simple remote procedure
calling. That is, a Lua script running on one machine can call
functions from a script that is running on another machine.

This is version 0.1, a pre-alpha release.

Original work done by Russell L. Smith:

Port to 5.x and continuing work by James Snyder.

BUILDING
--------

In order to build the module, just type:

make

This should succeed if you have Lua already installed on a Linux or Mac OS X
system. If it does not succeed, feel free to contact me at
jbsnyder@fanplastic.org.

As of May 28, 2009, serial and socket "transport" modes should be functional.
One can switch between these by selectively commenting/uncommenting lines in
config.h as below:

/* #define LUARPC_ENABLE_SOCKET */
#define LUARPC_ENABLE_SERIAL

This builds the module in serial mode. At this time, one cannot build with
multiple modes enabled (this may be added in the future).

USAGE
-----

The result of the build is a .so file that within a Lua script, one should be
able to simply do a:

require("luarpc")

with the module in the Lua path, and use the module as suggested in
test-client.lua and test-server.lua.

Ensure that your scripts reflect the type of enabled "transport" in use.
